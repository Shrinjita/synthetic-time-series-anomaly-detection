# synthetic-time-series-anomaly-detection
This project generates synthetic multivariate time series data simulating hardware metrics (CPU, memory, battery, etc.) with random anomalies. It includes anomaly detection using Isolation Forest and visualizes results. Ideal for testing anomaly detection models and simulating large-scale data.
